## Description

### Features

- Quickpoops is a web app that allows users to find approximatly how much they have pooped over their lifetime. A few simple questions will allow the user to recieve their total amount of poop as well as a couple of comparisons to help visualize how much it really is.

- Once the user has filled out their "poop profile" they have to option to share a screenshot of it as well as the link to the app.

- Another way that the user can share their poop is through our friend system. Users can scroll through their friends list and compare totals with the friends who have filled out their profiles.

- Users can add friends to their friends list by searching for them by username and requesting to be friends. the second user will then chose to either confirm and become friends or decline the request.
