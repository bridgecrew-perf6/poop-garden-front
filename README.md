# poop-garden-front

This is the front end for my poop garden app

## day-1 mar 21

- Today i finished the basic planning stage and started my ionic app. installed a basic get request to test axios and do some basic card rendering

## day-2 mar 22

- Today i was able to render a bar graph with API information. I had to do it on the page that i made the axios call because i was having trouble passing the props around. I need to get better at typescript. used chart.js

- I installed and implemented Pullstate which is a global state store library. I really like the ease of it so far and was able o remove an api call that i was making and just pass the data around through state properly.

- I think tomorrow I will start putting together my backend so that i can start trying to creat information and pull it back.

## day-4 mar 24

- added Auth0 ability to sign in and out. conditionally rendering the user's profile depending on whether they are signed in or out

- made the poop statistics page the homepage
